            <main>Hello, my name is Cash McBride and I am a self proclaimed adventurer. By adventurer I really mean that my wife and I like to travel. We've been to many wonderful destinations.</main>
            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                The first trip we ever went on was to New Mexico and Colorado! I had watched a show about anciet astronauts that had supposedly visited the American Southwest and wanted to see it for myself. I was able to talk my wife (girlfriend at the time) to come along and it was amazing.
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                The second trip we went on was a little over a year later to Jamaica! Originally we had just planned a simple vacation but it ended up being a destination wedding. It rained the first two days pretty much non stop but it gave us plenty of time for the wedding planning. After that it was absolutely perfect.
            </div>
            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                We have been on a few trips since. Went back to Jamaica then to Portugal and Ireland. We had such a blast in Portugal including a dinner at a Michelin Star restaurant. In Ireland we visited the sites in the North where they filmed the Winterfell scenes for Game of Thrones.
